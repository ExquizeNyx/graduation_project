# Validating QTLs using molecular assays
***
This repository contains data inspection, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and integration of eQTL and co-eQTL data with experimental high-throughput datasets, specifically MPRA (Massively Parallel Reporter Assay) and CRISPR-Cas9 interference scRNA-seq screens. 
The aim of this work is to address the challenges in identifying potential causal variants for disease risk by combining association studies (eQTL and co-eQTL) with experimental perturbation-based approaches.
